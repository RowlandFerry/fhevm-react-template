## Overview

The Food Safety Reporting System revolutionizes how food safety concerns are reported and investigated. By leveraging cutting-edge Fully Homomorphic Encryption from Zama's fhEVM, the platform ensures complete anonymity for whistleblowers while enabling authorized regulators to perform investigations and maintain food safety standards.

## Key Features

### For Whistleblowers
- **Complete Anonymity**: Identity never exposed or stored
- **Secure Submission**: End-to-end encryption using FHE
- **No Registration Required**: Report using just a Web3 wallet
- **Permanent Record**: Immutable blockchain storage prevents tampering
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor investigation progress anonymously

### For Regulators
- **Centralized Dashboard**: Overview of all reports and their status
- **Investigator Management**: Authorize and revoke investigator access
- **Priority Assessment**: Encrypted safety levels help prioritize cases
- **Geographic Insights**: Location-based statistics for trend analysis
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all actions and decisions

### For Investigators
- **Assigned Cases**: Clear workflow for investigation management
- **Controlled Access**: Decrypt only authorized information
- **Findings Documentation**: Record investigation results on-chain
- **Collaboration**: Multiple investigators can work on complex cases
- **Status Updates**: Keep stakeholders informed throughout the process

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Core Components

**AnonymousFoodSafety Contract**

The main contract implements:
- **Encrypted Report Submission**: All sensitive data encrypted using FHE
- **Role-Based Access**: Owner, regulator, and investigator roles
- **Investigation Workflow**: Structured process from submission to resolution
- **Privacy-Preserving Queries**: Statistical analysis without data exposure
- **Event Logging**: Transparent activity tracking

### Data Structures

```solidity
enum ReportStatus {
    Submitted,      // Report received
    UnderReview,    // Being reviewed
    Investigating,  // Active investigation
    Resolved,       // Investigation complete
    Closed          // Report closed
}

enum SafetyLevel {
    Unknown,        // Not yet assessed
    Safe,          // No significant issues
    Warning,       // Moderate concern
    Danger,        // Serious violation
    Critical       // Severe threat
}
```

### Key Functions

- `submitAnonymousReport()`: Submit encrypted food safety report
- `authorizeInvestigator()`: Grant investigation permissions
- `startInvestigation()`: Begin investigating a report
- `completeInvestigation()`: Record investigation findings
- `getTotalStats()`: Get system-wide statistics
- `getLocationStats()`: Get location-specific data

## Usage Examples

### Submit a Report

```javascript
await contract.submitAnonymousReport(
  3,      // SafetyLevel.Danger
  1001,   // Location code
  5001,   // Food type code
  "Expired ingredients found in storage area"
);
```

### Authorize an Investigator

```javascript
await contract.authorizeInvestigator(investigatorAddress);
```

### Start Investigation

```javascript
await contract.startInvestigation(reportId);
```

### Complete Investigation

```javascript
await contract.completeInvestigation(
  reportId,
  3, // Final safety level
  "Investigation confirmed: Issue resolved, facility compliant"
);
```

### Get Statistics

```javascript
const stats = await contract.getTotalStats();
console.log(`Total Reports: ${stats.total}`);
console.log(`Resolved: ${stats.resolved}`);
```

## Scripts

### Deployment Script

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

Deploys the contract and saves deployment information.

### Verification Script

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/verify.js --network sepolia
```

Verifies the contract on Etherscan.

### Interaction Script

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js --network sepolia
```

Demonstrates all contract functions with example data.

### Simulation Script

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/simulate.js --network localhost
```

Runs a complete simulation with multiple reports and investigations.

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests covering:

- âœ… Contract deployment
- âœ… Access control and permissions
- âœ… Report submission
- âœ… Investigation workflow
- âœ… Statistics and queries
- âœ… Batch operations
- âœ… Emergency controls
- âœ… Edge cases and error handling

Run tests with:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

Expected output:
```
  AnonymousFoodSafety
    âœ“ Should set the correct owner
    âœ“ Should allow report submission
    âœ“ Should authorize investigators
    ... (50+ tests)

  50 passing (5s)
```

## Security Considerations

### Privacy Protection

- All sensitive data encrypted with FHE
- Reporter identities never stored in plaintext
- Investigators only access authorized data
- Statistical queries preserve anonymity

### Access Control

- Three-tier permission system (Owner, Regulator, Investigator)
- Role-based function restrictions
- Emergency override capabilities for owner

### Data Integrity

- Immutable blockchain storage
- Cryptographic verification of all data
- Tamper-proof audit trail
- Event logging for transparency

## FHE Implementation

This project uses Zama's fhEVM for Fully Homomorphic Encryption:

- **Encrypted Data Types**: `euint8`, `euint32`, `eaddress`
- **Operations**: Comparisons and calculations on encrypted values
- **Privacy**: Computations without decryption
- **Security**: Industry-leading FHE implementation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Contract deployment fails
- Check you have sufficient testnet ETH
- Verify RPC URL is correct
- Ensure private key is set in .env

**Issue**: Tests fail
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed
- Check Hardhat network configuration
- Verify contract compilation succeeded

**Issue**: Verification fails
- Wait 1-2 minutes after deployment
- Ensure ETHERSCAN_API_KEY is set
- Confirm you're on the correct network
